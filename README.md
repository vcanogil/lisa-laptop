## What you REALLY need to know 
- Your BIOS password is "1234".
- To enter BIOS, press and hold F2 at startup
- To boot from a USB (in case you're restoring your system), hold F12 and choose the USB option. If it doesn't work, go into bios and enable F12 Boot menu under Main. 
- You will learn how to do most things but just looking around and clicking things and then reading. Things might be overwhelming for a couple of weeks but you'll get used to it and then you'll get to say "I use linux" with a sense of superiority to windows-peasants at dinner parties.
- Don't put laptop on your bed. Put it on top of a book or a bed table or something. Otherwise it'll be all dusty again.
- On the desktop, your have a "Lubunut Manual". It explains like some of the apps you have works. It's all right but nothing you can't learn by just clicking around and reading.

## Expected problems 
Most of them are probably going to associated with 
Acer firmware.

- Laptop doesn't boot
  - Connect to charger and try again.
- I see a "Secure boot failed" at startup, or something like that. There is
a picture of a lock on the screen.
  - Restart the laptop, enter BIOS. Under security, disable "secure boot". Save and exit.
- My laptop doesn't boot after I installed/updated something.
  - Use timeshift to restore, see timeshift instructions.
 
## Can I reach out if I'm having problems 
- You can but keep your expectations very low
- 99% of the problems you're likely to encounter will be solvable using google + chatgpt, or having a backup
- The lengths to which I'll try to help will depend on how busy I am and on my mood
