# What you need to know

## What you REALLY need to know 
- Your BIOS password is "1234".
- To enter BIOS, press and hold F2 at startup




## Expected problems 
Most of them are probably going to associated with 
Acer firmware.

- Laptop doesn't boot
  - Connect to charger and try again.
- I see a "Secure boot failed" at startup, or something like that. There is
a picture of a lock on the screen.
  - Restart the laptop, enter BIOS. Under security, disable "secure boot". Save and exit.
- My laptop doesn't boot after I installed/updated something.
  - Use timeshift to restore, see timeshift instructions.
