# Welcome to Linux and Lubuntu!

If you're transitioning from Windows, you’ll find that Linux is a powerful, flexible operating system that gives you more control over your system. Lubuntu is a lightweight, user-friendly version of Ubuntu, designed for users who want a simple yet efficient environment. Here’s everything you need to know to get started, manage your system, and understand how Linux works.

## Understanding Linux

Linux is an open-source operating system, which means its source code is publicly available and can be modified by anyone. Unlike Windows, where the system is more closed and proprietary, Linux gives users the freedom to customize and optimize their environment.

One key difference you'll notice is the **file system** in Linux. Linux uses a hierarchical directory structure that starts with the root directory (`/`), where everything is stored. Some of the main directories include:
- **/home**: Your personal files and settings are stored here.
- **/etc**: Configuration files for system-wide settings.
- **/usr**: System software and libraries.
- **/var**: Log files and variable data.

## Filesystem Permissions and `sudo`

In Linux, users have specific permissions that determine what they can and cannot do with files and system settings. By default, regular users have limited privileges to ensure system security.

**`sudo`** (short for "superuser do") is a command that allows you to perform actions with elevated privileges. For example, if you want to install software or modify system settings, you’ll need to prepend `sudo` to your commands:

```bash
sudo apt install <package_name>
```

After running a `sudo` command, you'll be prompted to enter your password. This ensures that only authorized users can make changes to the system.

## Software and Package Management

In Linux, there are two primary ways to install software: **APT packages** and **Snap packages**.

### 1. APT Packages

APT (Advanced Package Tool) is the traditional way to manage software on Ubuntu-based systems. You can install, update, and remove packages via the terminal, or you can use **Synaptic Package Manager**, which provides a graphical interface for managing APT packages.

To install software with APT via the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install <package_name>
```

### 2. Snap Packages

Snap packages are self-contained applications that come with all the dependencies they need, which simplifies installation. You can install Snap packages using the **Lubuntu Software Center (Discover)**, which provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for browsing and installing Snap apps.

## Browsing with Brave and Chrome

You have two browsers installed: **Brave** and **Chrome**. Brave is your default browser, offering features like built-in ad-blocking and enhanced privacy. If Brave ever has issues, **Chrome** is installed as a backup, ensuring you have a reliable browser available.

## Managing System Updates

One of the best things about Linux is its ability to keep your system up to date with minimal effort. Lubuntu provides a simple tool to check and apply updates.

### Running Updates

You should check for updates regularly, ideally once a week. When updates are available, you’ll be notified through the **Updates** app. This app will allow you to install all available updates with a few clicks.

### How to Run Updates:

- Open the **Lubuntu Software Center (Discover)** to install updates and new Snap packages.
- For APT packages, open **Synaptic Package Manager** to manage updates.

### Automatic Updates

Lubuntu checks for updates automatically, but it’s a good practice to manually check once a week. When you open the Updates app, it will display available updates. Simply click “Install” to apply them.

## Autoremove and System Cleanup

Over time, unused packages can accumulate. The **autoremove** feature helps clean up unnecessary software to free up space and keep your system lean. To run autoremove manually, you can use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt autoremove
```

You can also run **autoremove** through **Synaptic Package Manager** if you prefer a graphical interface.

## Power Management with TLP

Since you're focused on efficiency, **TLP** (TLP – Linux Advanced Power Management) is installed on your system to optimize power usage. TLP automatically adjusts settings related to battery performance, CPU scaling, and more to help extend battery life on laptops.

- TLP runs automatically and requires no intervention. If you'd like to check or adjust power settings manually, you can use the `tlp` command:

```bash
sudo tlp-stat -s
```

## System Tools and File Management

Your system comes preconfigured with a variety of essential applications to make your workflow smoother:

- **OnlyOffice**: A complete office suite for working with documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, similar to Microsoft Office.
- **Evolution**: A personal information management tool that integrates email, calendar, contacts, and tasks.
- **Okular**: A versatile document viewer for PDFs, eBooks, and more.
- **Apostrophe**: A minimalist markdown writing tool for distraction-free writing.
- **Featherpad**: A lightweight text editor for coding and basic text editing.
- **VLC Media Player**: One of the best media players available, supporting almost every format.
- **LXTerminal**: The default terminal emulator for running commands and interacting with the system.
- **System Control**: A graphical tool to manage system settings, users, and more.
- **PCManFM QT**: The file manager for navigating and managing your files.
- **Picom**: A lightweight compositor to add smooth window effects.

## Hidden Files in Linux

In Linux, **hidden files** are files and directories that are not shown by default when listing the contents of a directory. These files typically contain configuration settings, user preferences, or other system-related data that users don't generally need to interact with on a regular basis. Hidden files in Linux are used by many applications to store their settings or other crucial information about your environment.

### How to Identify Hidden Files

Hidden files in Linux have filenames that begin with a **dot (.)**. For example, `.bashrc`, `.config`, `.git` are all hidden files. These files are usually located in your home directory (`/home/username/`), but they can be found in other places as well.

To view these hidden files, you can use the `ls` command with the `-a` or `--all` option, which shows all files, including hidden ones:

```bash
$ ls -a
.   ..  .bashrc  .config  Documents  Desktop
```

In this case:
- The `.` represents the current directory.
- The `..` represents the parent directory.
- Files starting with a `.` are hidden files.

### How to Work with Hidden Files

1. **Viewing Hidden Files**
   To view the contents of a hidden file, use commands like `cat`, `less`, or `nano` with the file's full name (including the leading dot):

   ```bash
   $ cat .bashrc
   ```

2. **Editing Hidden Files**
   To edit a hidden file, you can use a text editor. For example, to edit `.bashrc`, you can use `nano`:

   ```bash
   $ nano .bashrc
   ```

   If you use a GUI text editor, ensure to specify the full path, or use the file manager to enable the option to show hidden files (most file managers have an option for this).

3. **Creating Hidden Files**
   You can create a hidden file by simply naming it with a leading dot. For example:

   ```bash
   $ touch .myhiddenfile
   ```

4. **Removing Hidden Files**
   Hidden files can be removed just like regular files, but always be careful when deleting them, as some configuration files are essential for system or application operation. You can use the `rm` command:

   ```bash
   $ rm .myhiddenfile
   ```

   **Be cautious:** Deleting critical hidden files (like `.bashrc` or `.profile`) can result in loss of custom configurations or environment settings.

### Why Hidden Files Matter

Hidden files are often used for:
- **System and Application Settings:** Many applications store their settings in hidden files. For example, `.bashrc` is used to configure your shell environment, `.gitconfig` contains Git configuration, and `.profile` stores user session settings.
- **Configuration and Cache Files:** Hidden files are also used to store temporary files or cache data, which can grow over time.
- **Preventing Clutter:** By hiding configuration files, Linux keeps the home directory neat and easier to navigate.

### Enabling Viewing of Hidden Files in GUI File Managers

In most graphical file managers (like **PCManFM QT**), you can toggle the display of hidden files. Here's how to do it:
- Open your file manager.
- Press `Ctrl + H` to toggle the visibility of hidden files.
- Alternatively, look for a "View" or "Settings" menu where you can enable "Show Hidden Files" or a similar option.

### Common Hidden Files and Directories

Some common hidden files and directories you may encounter in your home directory include:

- **`.bashrc`**: This file is executed whenever you open a new terminal session. It contains settings for your shell, including environment variables, aliases, and functions.
- **`.profile`**: This file is executed at login and is used for environment settings that affect all applications.
- **`.config/`**: This directory contains configuration files for various applications you use.
- **`.local/`**: This directory contains user-specific application data.
- **`.git/`**: This is the directory where Git stores information for version-controlled projects.
- **`.ssh/`**: This directory contains SSH keys and configuration files for secure shell access.


# Common Linux Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

While Linux is a powerful and flexible operating system, there are a few common pitfalls that users, especially new ones, might encounter. Understanding these can help you avoid mistakes that could potentially damage or break your system. Here are some tips and practices to follow to ensure that you don't inadvertently compromise your Linux environment.

## **Running Commands with `sudo` Carelessly**
   - **What to avoid**: Accidentally running dangerous commands with `sudo` (which gives you elevated privileges) can cause significant damage to your system. For example:
     ```bash
     sudo rm -rf /
     ```
     This command would delete all files in the root directory (`/`), rendering your system unusable.
   - **What to do**: Always double-check the command you’re about to run, especially if it involves `sudo`. Consider testing commands without `sudo` first to verify their effect before applying them to the entire system.

## **Messing with System Files**
   - **What to avoid**: Modifying or deleting important system files in directories like `/etc` or `/usr` can break your Linux installation. Files in these directories are essential for system operations, and altering them without understanding their purpose can lead to system instability or failure.
   - **What to do**: If you must edit system files (e.g., `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/fstab`), always make a backup first. Use a text editor like `nano` or `vim` with care. If you aren’t sure about the effect of a modification, look up the documentation first.

## **Overloading System Resources**
   - **What to avoid**: Running too many resource-intensive applications at once can cause your system to slow down or crash. This is particularly important for users with limited system resources (e.g., RAM or CPU power).
   - **What to do**: Use task manager tools like **System Monitor** (available in Lubuntu’s menu). Be mindful of the applications you have running and their impact on your system's performance.

## **Ignoring Software Updates**
   - **What to avoid**: Failing to keep your system and applications up-to-date can leave your system vulnerable to security risks and bugs. Some updates also include performance improvements and bug fixes that are important for system stability.
   - **What to do**: Regularly check for updates using the **Updates** app or **Lubuntu Software Center (Discover)**. Make it a habit to run updates at least once a week. Security patches should never be ignored.

## **Mixing Package Managers**
   - **What to avoid**: Using multiple package managers (e.g., APT, Snap, Flatpak, and Pacman) for the library at the same time on the same system can lead to dependency conflicts and errors. Installing the same software through different package managers can result in broken applications.
   - **What to do**: Stick with apt (synaptic manager) and Lubuntu software center. Install and/or delete your software through them only, unless you know what you're doing.

## **Using `root` Account Regularly**
   - **What to avoid**: Logging in as the `root` user for regular tasks is risky. It gives you unrestricted access to all system files and commands, which can lead to accidental destruction of important data or system files.
   - **What to do**: Use `sudo` for administrative tasks rather than logging in as `root`. This minimizes the risk of accidentally breaking your system.

## **Not Regularly Backing Up Data**
   - **What to avoid**: Failing to back up your data is one of the biggest mistakes you can make. Without backups, losing your data due to a system crash, software error, or user mistake can result in irreversible damage.
   - **What to do**: Backup your system using `Timeshift` and backup your files on google drive or something like that. 
     
## **Not Understanding File Permissions**
   - **What to avoid**: Incorrectly setting file permissions can expose your system to security vulnerabilities or prevent your system from working properly. For example, making sensitive files (like system logs or user directories) accessible to everyone can lead to security risks.
   - **What to do**: Learn how Linux file permissions work. Files and directories have three types of permissions: read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`). Always check the permissions of files you are modifying with the `ls -l` command and adjust them with `chmod` and `chown` when necessary.

## **Ignoring Logs**
   - **What to avoid**: Ignoring log files can make it harder to troubleshoot issues when things go wrong. System logs contain valuable information about the state of the system, errors, and warnings.
   - **What to do**: Regularly check your system logs for unusual behavior or error messages. You can view logs in **System Control**, or check them directly using commands like `journalctl` or by inspecting files in `/var/log/`.

## **Installing Software from Untrusted Sources**
   - **What to avoid**: Installing software from unofficial or untrusted sources can expose your system to malware and vulnerabilities.
   - **What to do**: Stick to official package repositories or trusted sources for installing software. If you must install software from third-party websites, ensure it's from a reputable source and that the package is verified.

## **Unnecessary Use of `rm -rf`**
   - **What to avoid**: The `rm -rf` command is very powerful and can delete files and directories without asking for confirmation. Using this command recklessly can cause loss of data or even render the system inoperable.
   - **What to do**: Always double-check your commands before running them, especially when using `rm`. Avoid running `rm -rf` on system directories. You can use the `-i` flag for a safer deletion process that prompts for confirmation before deleting files:

   ```bash
   rm -ri <directory_or_file>
